      <h6>Hope from the Dirt
Popular One-man Show Gets Second Life as Graphic Novel</h6>
      <blockquote>
        "You took something so painful in your life, and made it worth something."<br/>
In the decade-plus since John Morello launched his one-man dramatic show "Dirt," he has kept an ever-growing collection of notes and e-mails from teenagers (and some adults) from across the country, thanking him for speaking with them — not at them — about drugs, bullying, and other issues they face every day.

      <h6>The Road to Progress
Getting Up to Speed on the Massachusetts Health Information Highway </h6>
      <blockquote>
        On Oct. 16, another significant connection was completed — this one via videoconference. It was the launch of a secured line of communication between two large health care systems — Massachusetts General Hospital and Baystate Health, which took the first official trip on the Massachusetts Health Information Highway, or HIway. The HIway, through the Massachusetts Health Information Exchange (HIE), facilitates the secure transmittal of clinical information among health care information systems, while maintaining the meaning of the information, regardless of provider affiliation, location, or differences in technology. The HIway allows doctors and other clinicians a more comprehensive understanding of their patients’ full medical histories.
